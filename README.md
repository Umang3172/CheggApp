Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_48Tw8h1Q 

The Chegg Hackathon Prototype, an educational application, integrates various technologies such as Augmented Reality, Chatbots, Wikipedia API, Google API, Seanform, SQL, and Firebase to enhance the user's educational experience. Created in October 2022, its features include:

Study Section: This section is divided into Science, Chemistry, Engineering, and Maths subsections, each containing topics relevant to the respective field. Users can click on a topic to access information retrieved from the Wikipedia API and view AR models related to that topic, fetched from Firebase. Additionally, an AI-enabled chatbot assists students with mental health issues. Each STEM subject includes a books section where users can purchase or preview books via the Google API.

Test Section: Here, students can evaluate themselves through multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests. Results are displayed upon completion of the test, along with the time taken for each question.

Analysis Section: Users can visualize their past test scores through graphical representations in this section. Additionally, they can track their app usage over time.

Technologies used: Java, Firebase, Google Books API, Wikipedia API, Augmented reality, Dialogflow Chatbot
